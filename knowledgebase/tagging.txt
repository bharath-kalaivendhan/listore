What is tagging system?
- with tags, we can group links and make them easily searchable.
- finding related links will be easy

Refer:

Types of tagging:
- Predefined tags
- On-demand tags

Predefined tags
- First, we have to create a tags. (Only insert query)
- Then, we can map the created tags into links. (mapping query)

On-demand tags
- While adding a link, user can map link with tags.
- If a tag is already present, user will get suggested that while user typing.
- If not it will give a suggestion to add that.

Approach chose: On-demand tags
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/9385823
- there will 3 queries
- insert into tags (Note: unique constraint on tags name column in tags table)
- delete from link-tag mapping if not present in list
- insert all into link-tag mapping from list (Note: composite unique constraint on tag_id and link_id column in link-tag mapping table)
