Link Store

Phase 1:
- DB schema
	- Table to store links
		- columns
			- id type: varchar(36) [it is an uuid 32(hex) + 4(dashes)]
			- title type: varchar(256)
			- link type: varchar(2048)
	- Table to store tags(user can create as many tag as he want)
		- columns
			- id type: varchar(36) [it is an uuid 32(hex) + 4(dashes)]
			- tag type: varchar(128)
	- Table to store link and tag mapping(user can add many tags to a link)
		- columns
			- id type: varchar(36) [it is an uuid 32(hex) + 4(dashes)]
			- link_id type: varchar(36)
			- tag_id type: varchar(36)
	- Table to store thought on a link(user can add many thoughts to a link. but, we will implement for thought for a link)
		- columns
			- id type: varchar(36) [it is an uuid 32(hex) + 4(dashes)]
			- thought type: varchar(4096)

Doubt on max character limit on title and thought column:

How long can a hyperlink be?
- https://stackoverflow.com/a/5761115
- so, link column datatype can be varchar and its length can be 2k to 4k. but it can also be "text"

Why we need to store each tag mapping as separate?
- indexing would be easy
- searching and filtering would be easy
